### Minimum (Maximum) Path to Reach a Target

**Statement:** Given a target find minimum (maximum) cost/path to reach the target.

**Approach:** Choose minimum (maximum) path among all possible paths before the current state, then add value for the current state.

```cpp
routes[i] = min(routes[i-1], routes[i-2], ... , routes[i-k]) + cost[i]
```

Generate optimal solutions for all values in the target and return the value for the target.

```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= target; ++i) {
   for (int j = 0; j < ways.size(); ++j) {
       if (ways[j] <= i) {
           dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - ways[j]] + cost / path / sum);
       }
   }
}

return dp[target];
```

### Distinct Ways

**Statement:** Given a target find a number of distinct ways to reach the target.

**Approach:** Sum all possible ways to reach the current state.

```cpp
routes[i] = routes[i-1] + routes[i-2], ... , + routes[i-k]
```

Generate sum for all values in the target and return the value for the target.

```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= target; ++i) {
   for (int j = 0; j < ways.size(); ++j) {
       if (ways[j] <= i) {
           dp[i] += dp[i - ways[j]];
       }
   }
}

return dp[target];
```

### Merging Intervals

**Statement:** Given a set of numbers find an optimal solution for a problem considering the current number and the best you can get from the left and right sides.

**Approach:** Find all optimal solutions for every interval and return the best possible answer.

```cpp
// from i to j
dp[i][j] = dp[i][k] + result[k] + dp[k+1][j]
```

Get the best from the left and right sides and add a solution for the current position.

```cpp
for(int l = 1; l<n; l++) {
   for(int i = 0; i<n-l; i++) {
       int j = i+l;
       for(int k = i; k<j; k++) {
           dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + result[k] + dp[k+1][j]);
       }
   }
}
 
return dp[0][n-1];
```

### DP on Strings

**Statement:** Given two strings where lengths of those strings are not big, return some result.

**Approach:** Most of the problems on this pattern requires a solution that can be accepted in O(n^2) complexity.

```cpp
// i - indexing string s1
// j - indexing string s2
for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
   for (int j = 1; j <= m; ++j) {
       if (s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]) {
           dp[i][j] = /*code*/;
       } else {
           dp[i][j] = /*code*/;
       }
   }
}
```

If you are given one string `s` the approach may vary a little.

```cpp
for (int l = 1; l < n; ++l) {
   for (int i = 0; i < n-l; ++i) {
       int j = i + l;
       if (s[i] == s[j]) {
           dp[i][j] = /*code*/;
       } else {
           dp[i][j] = /*code*/;
       }
   }
}
```

### Decision Making

**Statement:** Given a set of values find an answer with an option to choose or ignore the current value.

**Approach:** If you decide to choose the current value use the previous result where the value was ignored; vice-versa, if you decide to ignore the current value use previous result where value was used.

```cpp
// i - indexing a set of values
// j - options to ignore j values
for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
   for (int j = 1; j <= k; ++j) {
       dp[i][j] = max({dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j] + arr[i], dp[i-1][j-1]});
       dp[i][j-1] = max({dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1] + arr[i], arr[i]});
   }
}
